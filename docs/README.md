# Atlas Project Documentation

Welcome to the consolidated documentation for the Atlas project. This folder has been refactored to provide a clean, clear, and authoritative source of information.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following key areas:

- **`/architecture.md`**: The single source of truth for the entire system architecture. This document covers the high-level vision, tech stack, data models, component design, and API specifications. Start here for any technical questions.

- **`/project/`**: This directory contains all product and project management documents.
    - **`prd.md`**: The comprehensive Product Requirements Document, detailing the project's goals, user personas, and functional requirements.
    - **`roadmap.md`**: The high-level implementation roadmap and timeline. (Note: This file was not present in the original `docs` folder and may need to be created or moved here).

- **`/archive/`**: This directory contains all previous, now-obsolete documentation files. It is preserved for historical reference but should not be used for current development.

---

This new structure ensures that all information is easy to find and that there is no redundant or conflicting documentation.
