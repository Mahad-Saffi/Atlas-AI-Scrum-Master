  <h2>Sprint Retrospective</h2>

    <tr>
      <th>Topic</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>What worked well this sprint?</b></td>
      <td>- Communication: Our daily standups were effective, especially on Wednesday when we quickly identified Hassaan's blocker. The communication between Omer and Hassaan to resolve it was fast and clear.<br>- Collaboration: Omer and Hassaan paired up for a short session on Thursday to integrate the final authentication flow, which was much more efficient than working in silos.<br>- Process: The team did a great job of following the Git workflow for branching and pull requests, which made code reviews smooth and easy to track.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>What didn’t work so well this sprint?</b></td>
      <td>- Estimation Process: Our team's estimation for the testing task didn't fully account for the difficulty of mocking the external GitHub API. This put unexpected pressure on Salman and Omer near the end of the sprint.<br>- Knowledge Sharing: The expertise for mocking external services was concentrated with one person. When that approach hit a roadblock, it was difficult for other team members to offer effective help.<br>- Tooling Friction: We lost about half a day debugging a Docker networking issue between the frontend and backend containers that could have been avoided with better initial documentation for the setup.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>What will we do to improve next sprint?</b></td>
      <td>- Action Item (Process): In our next sprint planning, we will use a quick "complexity vote" (1-3 fingers) specifically for any task that involves external APIs to make our estimates more accurate.<br>- Action Item (Team): Omer will hold a 30-minute optional session on how to use the `respx` library for mocking APIs, so more of the team is familiar with it.<br>- Action Item (Documentation): Mahad will add a "Common Gotchas" section to the project's main `README.md` file with a note about the Docker container networking configuration.</td>
