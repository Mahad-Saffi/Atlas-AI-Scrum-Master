  <h2>Sprint Retrospective</h2>

      <th>Topic</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>What worked well this sprint?</b></td>
      <td>- Process Improvement: Prioritizing and fixing the leftover testing issue from Sprint 1 at the very beginning of this sprint was a great success. It unblocked our CI/CD pipeline and restored the team's confidence in our test suite.<br>- Collaboration: The focused design session between Omer (Backend) and Hassaan (Frontend) to define the JSON structure for the chat messages was highly effective. It took only 30 minutes and prevented any integration problems.<br>- Focus: The team did an excellent job of concentrating only on the two user stories for this sprint. We successfully avoided scope creep by tabling discussions about more advanced AI features for a future sprint.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>What didn’t work so well this sprint?</b></td>
      <td>- Initial Uncertainty: There was some initial confusion on Wednesday about how to manage the conversation state in LangChain. Omer spent a few hours researching different methods, which was valuable but not explicitly planned for.<br>- Communication Lag: On Thursday morning, Hassaan had to wait for a clarification from Omer on the final API response format. A quick, direct message would have been faster than waiting for the next daily standup and could have saved an hour of idle time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>What will we do to improve next sprint?</b></td>
      <td>- Action Item (Planning): For future sprints involving new technologies (like the AI plan generation in Sprint 3), we will add a specific "Research/Spike" task to the backlog to formally allocate time for exploration and reduce uncertainty.<br>- Action Item (Communication): We will encourage more ad-hoc communication for small clarifications. If a question can be answered in 2 minutes via a direct message or call, we will do that instead of waiting for the next daily standup.</td>
